# commath2
An improved version of the commath LaTeX-package.
Most of the code is from [egreg](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4427/egreg)'s response to a question on StackExchange regarding commath, which can be seen [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/135985/31078).

## commath2-additions
This additional package defines useful macros for second derivatives (`\pdd`, `\dpdd`, `\odd`, `\dodd`), and derivatives with respect to *x*, *y*, *z* and *t* (`\pdx`, `\dpdx`, `\odx`, `\dodx`, etc.), and the material derivative (`\matd` or `\mD`).

# Installation
Put `commath2.sty` in your local texmf, at `texmf/tex/latex/commath2/` and `commath2-additions.sty` in `texmf/tex/latex/commath2-additions/`.
